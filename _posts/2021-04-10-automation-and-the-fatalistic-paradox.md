Recent these days I've hold a friendly discussion with a man that claimed to be a Tory, and it was quite enlightening on the point that the guy was a young individual, rock grunge looking dude that you may have not expected to hold such an ideology, I like to see people breaking the cliches in such a way.
Been a Tory, defined as a Liberal conservative person, often more accented in the former than the latter. There is nothing wrong on that, myself I embrace year by year a bit more into conservative values, but about liberalism I would say I follow the oposite trend.
In this discussion the guy started of by saying that he is working for a **Tech Startup** which deals with **AI** technologies applied to social white collar jobs such as **journalism automation** , in the form that his company was meant to create a workflow for **newspapers , magazines** and the like , in a way that the **algorithm** wrote up a bunch of articles in a daily basis , based on some input, and the work of the journalist was to merely ; filter the articles which were **commercially atractive** , overview them giving them that **human touch** and post them.
It is actually a smart idea I really liked it , and there is no doubt that in the coming years we won't be able to distinguish if the source of the grammar we are reading comes from the interaction of a Biological brain sending electric stimuluous to some fingers hammering a mechanical keyboard.

My point is that I love technology and I so much Implement it on my daily basis, but technological advantages have big trade-offs, the consequences of implementing a technology has some desired advantages, such as allowing tasks to be automatised, freeing the **Master Human** of having to do such a repetitive thing so it can dedicate his time to other task.
The desired consequence of this is thatone , but the undesired trade-off originated from this comes from the need of humans to actually fill in their time with tasks that allow them overcome the natural environment.
This last part is a psycological remant, or not just remant but something that we have built in our genes, and that is the **sole purpose of our existence**.
We get an straight good feed from our brains in the form of neurotransmitters, whenever we accomplish a task that will set ourselves in a better position towards our objective of surviving. Nowadays we don't need to go on a raid with other fellow humans to go and hunt down mammoths, but we pretty much do so by doing the Laundry everyonce in a week, go to work to get those magic **green paper grain** that allow us get food, which we then cook to turn it to a meal.

A day in a human is not that different as it used to be in terms of our relationship with the environment, and although all the things we do in a day are not 100% survival focused there is a sheer amount of them, although we have entretainments such as games, music and some other forms of leisure that are not strictly related to survival. 
In this we can say that we may be able to swap time from the survival tasks , into leisure one. Still a human need to feel that is accomplish something, and this substitution process have to be gradual, otherwise you can deem someone as **useless**.  
My view with automation is critic, in the form that we have already experienced some of its phases, first in The Industrial Revolution, the Luddites were against the form of automations based in this idea.  
Time has proben them wrong in many ways, but we won't know what would have been the world should this **restrictions** to the implementation of technology have been applied by the society. 
My point is that we are facing yet another **turning point** as the introduction of **AI technologies** is done gradually. These technologies are able to automate almost everything, **AI** resembles **neural networks** in the form a **human brain** work, so tasks that were not automated yet for the compexity of the logic applied for that task is now done by resembling how human brain actually works giving the machine the ability to learn **"Machine Learning"**.

Let's take the example of driving, is a quite complex taks in what it involves dealing with many visual and sound stimulous, turning them into a decision of moving a steering wheel, pushing the pedals and turning gears. This is such a complex scenario which the human brain gets adapted so well as it applies a logic of disciminate what inputs are important and what are not that much important for the decision making, based on the mere experience. 
Still after years of development, this technology hasn't been implemented , but it surely will in the coming years, most likely in 10 years we will start seeing auto-pilot cars and self-driving lorries and vans.
This introduction will come along a huge raise of unemployment for all the economies in the world, the scope of it is as big, that no complementary jobs will be able to retain this process. 
Along with this comes the necesity by the Countries to introduce taxes on automation, as the production gets automated, the corporations have less need of people on the Supply Chain, still they need people on the Demand Chain that purchases its products, in order to not to fall in this **fatalistic paradox** the only way is to nationalise the means of production, cause is difficult to see that those people are going to be employed on either the **management positions** or in other more human less prone to be automised sectors such as arts , as is a sector that is not instrisically linked to human basic needs, is not likely that big amounts of money will get channelized into these sectors in such a way that it can absorb those figures.

I don't dislike **liberalism** for the sake of it, it's paradigm has helped the society to evolve at the fastest rate possible. And I mean paradigm as it is the extreme ideal for what the decision makers base their decisions, in its most extreme form the US may have been the ones who most embraced this ideology, whereas in Europe it has been watered down by importance of a State and Social-Democracies. 
What I am talking about is nothing new in Economic theory, and every introdutory **Public Sector** manual that has been written starts off with the acknowledgment of the concept of **Market Failures** such as *Joseph Stiglitz - Economics of The Public Sector*.      
And I am conviced that the **Politicians, Goverments** and **lobbyists** world-wide are aware of the mentioned fatalistic-paradox that we are facing with automation, and they are walking towards introducing some sort of measures that will ensure that the money keeps in motion according to the (Circular Flow Model)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uermjo6J42c&t=226s] , but there is going to be a big stake been negociated in the coming years on how to implement policies such as if we Should Tax the Corporations for Unit of Labour automatised? , how do we measure that? shoudln't the goverments then purchase or nationalised equity from those firms Nationalising the profit in the form of **Universal-Basic-Income**? Should we otherwise discourage families to have children and reducing the need of allocate that Surplus among individuals that are not part of a usefull workforce anymore?. 
And if we go to the Egg rather than the Chicken, Why wouldn't the society be able to impose some restrictions on techological advantages in order to avoid the necesity of turning the whole system upside down for the sake of aimless technological development. Some **traditional societies** like **Amish** have other views in regards with the introduction of Technological Developments, they make a cost-benefit calculation before hand bringing any new device in.

Sometimes I feel like we are introducing new gadgets to our primate based brains, without gauging the consequences of it beforehand. It is if like everything "tech" related sounds like a cool thing to do, we are adopting patterns of consumption based on few **tech giants** such as ; Amazon, Apple, Google , Netflix etc... with its consequences to the centuries well established local trade , embracing Economically harmful Oligopolies based in foreign firms seeing it as a cool thing to "Google" or "Netflix" something , the Monopoly has never been sold so good, dressing it in silicon.
