If you have a walk through a countryside park you will see a variety of species that form together the richness of the whole experience, when you pay for a lodge to stay out in some bank holiday you are actually counting with that display that the natural environment will bring you. None of this creatures are under salary, and they certainly haven't been generated with a machine, this is a process that took millions of years, that different species in which some are hunters of some others they co-exist in a fragile harmony that has been undisrupted still in few areas , patches, of our planet.
It is a scientific fact that altering one of the inputs of such an ecosystem will have de-balancing effect that may end up with the disruption of it, and certainly will balance itself in a new equilibrium, but disruptions cannot be long in time otherwise it may face a mass extinction. 

Yesterday it has been announced that the Top football Clubs from England, Spain and Italy want to segregate from the current European league creating a new one more lucrative one governed by them, in which they will play more matches in between each other, making it thus more profitable for spectators who will enjoy more Top European matches every season.
The disruption will have effects on the National leagues, which they will have to reduce the amount of matches they play domestically, and also the way they qualify will be based on just the Commercial revenue that the team's brand can bring to the broadcast contract revenue. 

This way , financially struggled clubs such as Barcelona or Juventus can see the light at the end of the tunnel and sanitize their sheets.
And there is nothing wrong on seeing football as a lucrative business, and try to make the most of it, but altering the pure foundations of the club structure wont do any otherthing but damage it at long term.
If you release a thousand of steaks in the park, the predators may be on happy days, and their population will likely grow, that will make their prey struggle even more. Sometimes more doesn't mean not better.

One of the joys of watching Competitions like the Champions League or the World Cup is the uniqueness of the matches, you don't see everyday an Argentina vs England , or a Liverpool vs Real Madrid, and as you don't see that so often when it does happen the Celebration of football is great, but I would so much doubt that subsequent staged Liverpool vs Real Madrid matches are not going to do much good for the revenue in the long term.  

The greatness of this clubs arise from the fact that they are able to mostly every year beat their national rivals and win their national Cup and Leagues, cause this is not a universal fact, many times they do not win, and back in the times (where the revenue of teams was most balanced, where the Football Club market acted more as a perfect competitive market) it was not that much common. 

The players are not generated spontaneously in a machine, they are kids they been brought up to their home-town team stadium by their grandfather, they wear the boots, and they grow in a regional environment in which really few of them end up really making it through all the steps. But they end up there, dressing the White and Red elastic t-shirt of "los colchoneros" , proud of what they represent.  

If you start decreasing the amount of matches played domestically (therefore the contribution of big clubs to the huge growing fields of regional football), you stop watering this financially, and mentally as well. 
If that happen in Europe they may have to sign more South American and African players, as our fields will be on draught. 

A big chunk of the brand these clubs are selling has been forged after memorable battles with domestic clubs, are you telling us that now they are going to take that brand for themselves negating the revenue to the rest of the league that they belong?  

This is nothing but a bitter day for European football, something that will definitely kill the entretainment on te long run of a historic instituion that is part of every citizen in these countries, we represent what it brought us here, our local teams and our deceased ancestors that wanted us to sit in that chair in the Stadium every Sunday.
