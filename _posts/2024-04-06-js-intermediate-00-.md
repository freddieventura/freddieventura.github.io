# Title

## Javascript Intermediate tutorials

This tutorial is part of **freddieventura** Javascript Intermediate tutorials.
By writting this I aim to give my little contribution to all of those who are in the process of learning Javascript taking it a step further.

May I have been lucky a Search Engine has taken you here, I did pass you the link, or you are my follower for any other reason, I encourage you to take your time and read through it.

None of the text has been written with the help of LLM (AI), only the head image.

The tutorial are examples I have been executing myself in order to proove the concepts.
I encourage you to do your own ones. 

I have used **nodejs** as Execution environment.


Apologies if the formatting is not perfectly coherent, but they are just a transcription of my notes to this markdown processor. 

As main source of information I list the following :
    - [Mdn Web Docs Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
    - [Mdn Web Docs Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

Which I comfortably read from my terminal via [vim-dan](https://github.com/freddieventura/vim-dan)
